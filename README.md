# EchoLogyx Work

To get started,

## First install project dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Then, set desired project path in `project-path.txt` file in root directory.

## Create/Generate variation template

```sh
npm run create
```

The above command will create some template/boilerplate files inside the project directory specified in the `project-path.txt` file.

## Now you are ready to start local development

```sh
npm run dev
```

Dev server will compile the code inside the `src` directory of the specified project path in `project-path.txt` file. So make sure to specify the correct project path in `project-path.txt` file.

## Local dev done? Ready to build production files?

```sh
npm run build
```

_The built JavaScript file won't contain any console logs so don't worry!_

**Now, you're ready to put the built/compiled code into the tools. Enjoy!**
