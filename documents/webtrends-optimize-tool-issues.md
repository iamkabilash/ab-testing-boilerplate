# Webtrends issues

1. Page/App load time very slow. Sometimes it takes more than 10 seconds.
2. You won't be able to change the control radio button after initial setup.
3. You can't delete a metric after creation.
4. If your test depends on any live test, then to preview your test in WTO, you will have to clone that live test and put it in staging state. That's seems problematic to me. There should be better ways to handle this.
5. You can add integration but there is no interface for that.
6. The only way we can do custom (audience/page) targeting is using OBF framework. Sometimes it takes additional time to do that in compare to the other AB testing tools.
7. The WTO tag is not implemented properly, as a result we often experience control flashing.
